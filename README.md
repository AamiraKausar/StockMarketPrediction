# Stock Market Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts stock price movement (up or down) using historical stock data. Two models are used:

1. Logistic Regression  
2. Random Forest  

All work is done in a **Jupyter Notebook** for easy execution.



## Files in this Submission
- StockMarketPrediction.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook with all code, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- Dataset/stock_data.csv : Dataset used for training and testing.  
- Results : Folder containing plots/images generated by the notebook.  
- writeup.pdf : Short report explaining approach, challenges, and improvements.



## How to Run
1. Open Anaconda Navigator â†’ Launch Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Open the notebook file: `internship.ipynb`.  
3. Run all cells in order (Shift + Enter) to:  
   - Preprocess the data  
   - Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models  
   - Evaluate results and generate plots  



## Results
Example images are included in the `Results/` folder:

## Notes
- Outliers were handled using log transformation instead of IQR.  
- Metrics used for evaluation:Accuracy, Precision, Recall 
- Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression in all metrics.
